# C# Code Challenges

Welcome to my **C# Code Challenges** repository! This collection of projects is the culmination of my learning journey through various C# challenges, with inspiration from the **LinkedIn Learning Challenge** by **Harrison Ferrone** and self-designed projects. These challenges explore a wide range of core C# functionalities and aim to solve real-world problems using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Overview
This repository contains standalone projects that address different types of logic problems, demonstrating hands-on experience with the key tools and features of C#. Each project is designed to simulate real-world scenarios, providing valuable experience in applying C# programming concepts.

## Projects
Here’s a snapshot of the projects you'll find in this repository:

- **Card Shuffling Program**: A simulation of randomization techniques and data manipulation, utilizing LINQ and lists to shuffle a deck of cards.
- **Tipping Calculator Program**: A practical application of arithmetic operations and conditionals, calculating tips based on user input.
- **Shopping Inventory Program**: Demonstrating the use of collections like dictionaries and indexers, mimicking an inventory management system.
- **Fibonacci Sequence Calculator**: An implementation of loops and mathematical operations to generate Fibonacci numbers.
- **Email Validation Program**: A regular expression-based email validator that enforces format rules, such as checking for valid symbols and domain suffixes.
- **URL Parser Program**: A string manipulation project that breaks down URLs into components by removing, replacing, and splitting parts of the URL.
- **Scrabble-Like Word Scoring**: A dictionary-based scoring system that assigns points to vowels in a word, demonstrating the use of control flow and dictionaries.
- **Player Score Tracker**: A project that calculates player scores, highlighting list sorting, statistical operations (max, min, average), and LINQ queries.
- **Car Factory Program**: Utilizing abstract classes and inheritance to model a car factory, with dynamic type discovery using reflection.

## Key Concepts and Tools
Across these projects, I have applied a variety of **C#** concepts and tools, including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Core principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **LINQ**: Fluent syntax for querying and manipulating collections (e.g., `Where()`, `GroupBy()`, `Max()`, `Min()`, `Sum()`, `Average()`).
- **JSON Serialization and Deserialization**: Converting C# objects to and from JSON format.
- **Data Structures**: Extensive use of lists, arrays, dictionaries, stacks, queues, and hash sets for data storage and manipulation.
- **Reflection**: Dynamic discovery and interaction with types at runtime (e.g., finding subclasses in a car factory program).
- **String Manipulation**: Operations such as pattern matching with regex, splitting, joining, and replacing characters.
- **Error Handling**: Using `try-catch` blocks to manage exceptions and ensure the robustness of programs.
- **Control Flow**: Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `foreach`, `while`) to handle various logical paths and iterations.
- **Statistical Calculations**: Calculating max, min, sum, and average from data sets using both manual iteration and LINQ methods.
- **Timers**: Implementing repeating actions with `System.Timers.Timer`.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Performing calculations for various problems, including Fibonacci sequence generation and word scoring.

## Future Exploration
While these projects cover a wide range of topics, there are still areas to explore, such as linked lists and more advanced data structures. This repository is a stepping stone for further growth in C#.

## Conclusion
This repository showcases my practical knowledge of C# programming, applying it to solve complex problems and deepen my understanding of the language’s capabilities. Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or even contribute!
