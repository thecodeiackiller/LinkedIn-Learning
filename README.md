# C# Code Challenges

Welcome to my C# Code Challenges repository! This collection of projects is a culmination of my journey through the LinkedIn Learning Challenge titled "C# Code Challenges" by Harrison Ferrone. The projects within this solution focus on enhancing real-world problem-solving skills by diving deep into the logic and core functionalities of C#.

## Overview

This repository contains several standalone projects, each dedicated to solving different types of logic problems while applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The challenges are designed to simulate real-world scenarios, providing hands-on experience with various key features and tools in C#. Below is an overview of what you can expect to find:

### Projects
- **Card Shuffling Program**: An implementation that explores randomization and data manipulation.
- **Tipping Calculator Program**: A practical application that calculates tips based on user input, demonstrating the use of conditionals and arithmetic operations.
- **Shopping Inventory File**: A project focusing on data structures and indexing, mimicking an inventory management system.

### Key Concepts and Tools

Throughout these projects, the following C# concepts and tools were utilized:
- **LINQ**: Querying and manipulating collections with a fluent syntax.
- **JSON Deserialization and Serialization**: Converting JSON data to and from C# objects.
- **Data Structures**: Including Lists, Arrays, Dictionaries, Stacks, and Queues.
- **Indexes**: Efficiently accessing and managing data within collections.
- **Conditionals and Exception Handling**: Implementing control flow and managing runtime errors with `try-catch` blocks.
- **String Manipulation**: Modifying and interacting with text data using various methods.
- **Primitive and Generic Types**: Working with basic data types and creating reusable, type-safe code.
- **OOP Principles**: Applying concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to design robust software solutions.

### Future Exploration

Although the course did not cover Linked Lists, this will be an area of focus in my continued learning. The logic and principles explored in these projects lay a strong foundation for more advanced topics in C#.

## Course Description

In **C# Code Challenges**, Harrison Ferrone introduces a series of bite-sized modular problems and step-by-step solution walkthroughs that help you navigate your own projects. The course starts simple with string and data set modifications, moves on to intermediate topics like algorithms and data persistence, and finishes with advanced C# language features. Through this course, I have built real problem-solving skills with fun and actionable examples.

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a testament to my growing expertise in C# and my commitment to mastering the language's many features. Feel free to explore the projects, provide feedback, or even contribute to the repository!
